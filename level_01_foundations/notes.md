# Level 1: Foundations of Generative AI

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI creates new content like text, images, code, or audio. It learns patterns from massive datasets and generates similar but new outputs. It powers tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and GitHub Copilot.

## Why is it important?
- It saves time by automating content generation
- It can enhance creativity, productivity, and personalization
- It's being adopted across industries: media, healthcare, finance, e-commerce

## Core Concepts:
- **LLM**: Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
- **Token**: Small chunk of text like words or subwords
- **Prompt**: The instruction you give the model
- **Inference**: The model generating output based on the prompt
- **Fine-tuning**: Training a pre-trained model further on custom data
- **Embeddings**: Numeric representations of text that preserve meaning

## Examples:
- Netflix → Gen AI for content summaries, title recommendations
- Zomato → AI-generated dish descriptions
- Spotify → Mood-based playlists using Gen AI
- GitHub Copilot → Auto-suggested code
